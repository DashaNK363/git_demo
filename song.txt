You are a shadow
Following me where I go
I’d be better without you
What are you doing to me?

I’m suffocating
Don’t know how to explain it
But I feel like I’m fading
What are you doing to me?

You’ve been putting me through hell
I should really run for help
I’d leave you for someone else
Too bad you can’t leave yourself

Loosen your grip before choke
Can’t catch my breath, I’m gonna choke
I wish that you’d just let me go
I don’t want this, I promise, just leave
